<h4>Statement</h4>
<article><p>I'm interested in design as both a noun and a verb. My work focuses on design as a process; the act of forming ideas and giving ideas form. I attempt to use design as a form of inquiry to redefine what graphic design can be. I believe that design is ideology made artifact and must respond to the world around it. Recently, I've been interested in reflexivity in design, identity systems, media theory, strategic design, and design fictions. Recent work can be seen on <a href="http://www.twenty-six.design">my studio's website</a>.</p>

<p>In the last few years, teaching has become a central part of my practice. I've taught in both graduate and undergraduate design program at a variety of schools including The New School, Pratt Institute, University of the Arts, and Maryland Institute College of Art. For me, the classroom is where all my interests really come together: design, writing, criticism, discussion, thinking, making, performing, etc. As a teacher, I'm interested in fostering in my students a love of process and experimentation, cultivating authorship and voice, and thinking critically about their work and the profession at large. You can see a list of courses I've taught and sample syllabi <a href="http://www.jarrettfuller.com/teaching">here</a>.</p>

<p>I also host and produce <a href="http://www.scratchingthesurface.fm">Scratching the Surface</a>, a weekly podcast which is ostensibly about the 'intersection of design criticism and practice' but has evolved to cover all sorts of things I'm interested in including expanded practices, teaching, and design theory. It's basically an excuse for me to talk to people I find interesting and has been featured on <i>Architectural Digest</i>, <i>Dezeen</i>, <i>Design Observer</i>, <i>Lecture in Progress</i>, and was included in <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2017/12/18/16778058/architecture-awards-2017">Curbed's Best Of 2017 list</a>.</p>

<p>As a writer, my work focuses on a range of topics including design criticism, history, and cultural commentary. Recent writing and research have dealt with ideas around design education, technology, smart cities, the internet-of-things, and the intersection of philosophy and design. In 2018, I designed and co-edited <a href="https://amzn.to/2O3bDmU"><i>Culture is Not Always Popular: Fifteen Years of Design Observer</i></a> with Michael Bierut and Jessica Helfand, that collects over 60 essays from the website Design Observer.</p>

<p>I'm drawn to the idea of the 'art monster' from Jenny Offill's book <i>Dept. of Speculation</i> (<a href="http://scratchingthesurface.fm/post/173503530035/74-peter-mendelsund">Peter Mendelsund introduced me to this concept in my interview with him</a>.) where one's interest is in working across mediums and disciplines without being constrained by disciplinary definitions. In addition to design, I dabble in <a href="http://www.instagram.com/jarrettfuller">photography</a>, painting, <a href="http://www.jarrettfuller.com/playlists">producing playlists</a>, and making pizza.</p>

<p>I spend my free time reading <a href="http://jarrettslibrary.tumblr.com">lots of books</a>, watching movies, and practicing yoga. Outside of work, I'm interested in podcasts, media theory, philosophy, urbanism, cooking, and coffee.</p>
