            <article><p>Jarrett Fuller is a designer and writer. He currently is completing his MFA from Maryland Institute College of Art focusing on graphic design, criticism, and curation, where he is also adjunct faculty. He also hosts the weekly podcast, <a href="http://www.scratchingthesurface.fm">Scratching the Surface</a> where he interviews designers, writers, and educators about the intersection of design criticism and practice.</p>

<p>From 2013 to 2015, he was a designer at <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> on their Business Marketing team where he worked on a range of interactive, branding, and environmental projects. Previously he was a designer at <a href="http://www.warbyparker.com">Warby Parker</a> and has continued a freelance practice where he's worked with clients large and small, including Instagram, John Hopkins University, and Wondermade.

                <h4>Process</h4>
            <article><p>My work focuses on design as a process; the act of forming ideas and giving ideas form. Iâ€™m attempting to use design as form of inquiry and using the process to discover what design can be. Recent projects have focused on design fictions, reflexivity in design, identity systems, publishing, and designer as author.</p>

<p>As a writer, my work has focused on a range of topics from design history, criticism, and cultural commentary. Recent essays have dealt with how emerging technologies effect the graphic design process, media distribution and publishing, and identity systems. </p>
