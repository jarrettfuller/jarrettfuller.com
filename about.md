<h4>Now (updated May 13, 2021)</h4>
 <article><p>After a few years in Brooklyn, I prepping to move to Raleigh, North Carolina later this summer to begin a new position as assistant professor of graphic design at North Carolina State University. I’m excited to fully-dedicate my work to design pedagogy and anxious to dig into this new city, institution, and community. </p>

<p>Alongside this new position, I continue to both edit and write for AIGA Eye on Design and host and produce Scratching the Surface. I’m working on essays that continue my ongoing research around design criticism and have had the privilege to commission and edit pieces on media history, work culture, and design history. I’m currently finishing up editing a book project for Parsons School of Design commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Communication Design program. Scratching the Surface, as always, continues to chug along.</p>

<p>I’m consulting more lately, mostly with folks interested in design publishing and strategy, alongside more traditional design work. I’ve been thinking a lot about the intersections of creative practice and administration and continuing my research on polymathic practices. I’m always working on a <a href="/playlists">playlist</a> or two.</p>

<p>In what free time I have, I’ve been <a href="/library">reading a lots of books</a>, watching movies, running, practicing yoga, and cooking. I continue experiment with natural wines, making pizzas, and fermentation. I’m itching to get back to photography and painting.</p>

It’s set in <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla">Karla</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tinos">Tinos</a> and served up via Google Fonts. You are free to adapt, remix, reuse, and update both the code and visual design for your own needs. That said, if you do use the code for your own site, please include a credit and link back here.
