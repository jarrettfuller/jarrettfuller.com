title: The Catalyst
tags: Podcast
discription: The Catalyst is a short form, limited run podcast series where I interviewed designers, classmates, and professors about how they became designers and the pivotal moments in their life that set them on their creative lives. The 13-part series were edited into half-hour episodes and live on a custom website.
