title: "Eye on Design x Scratching the Surface: How Can We Practice Design Without Harming the Planet"
tags: Event
discription: "As part of the first day of AIGA's 2020 Design Conference, I co-organized a symposium with Meg Miller around the intersection of design and ecology. Co-presented by both Eye on Design and Scratching the Surface, we featured three sessions of interviews with designers and thinkers around questions regarding sustainibility, climate change, nature, and the environment. During the event, I interviewed architect and writer Julia Watson about her book <i>Lo-TEK: Design by Radical Indigenism</i>. (This conversation will also be repackaged as a Scratching the Surface episode in the future.)"
