title: Fuller Display Light
category: Typography
discription: Fuller Display Light is a decorative typeface based on a few of my favorite faces; most notably Bodoni, Archer, and Neutra. The 1920's style face features a capital and lowercase set as well alternate characters, numbers, and full punctuation.
