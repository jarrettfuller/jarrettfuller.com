* Salt
* ¾ pound casarecci, gemelli or gigli pasta
* 1 cup Greek yogurt (preferably Fage's Total)
* ½ pound smoked salmon, cut into bite-size pieces
* 1 clove garlic, smashed and chopped
* Zest and juice of 1 Meyer lemon
* 2 cups packed arugula
* 1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh dill
* Coarsely ground black pepper

Bring a large pot of salty water to a rolling boil. Add the pasta. While it cooks, combine in a large serving bowl the yogurt, salmon, garlic, lemon zest and juice, arugula and dill. Just before the pasta is finished cooking, scoop out 1/2 cup pasta water and reserve.

Drain the pasta and slide it into the bowl. Using two spoons, toss the pasta and sauce as you would a salad. If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water. Season to taste with salt and grind a generous amount of pepper on top.
