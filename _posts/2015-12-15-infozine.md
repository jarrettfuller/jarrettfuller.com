title: The Information Zine
category: Design
discription: The Information Zine is an eight-page, two color zine printed on newsprint about the history of information distribution, access, and censorship. This piece, using the form of the zine (a traditional sub-cultural form of distribution), chronicles the complicated history. The form of the zine itself, then, becomes a method of distribution while constantly balancing obstruction and access. A companion digital version was also created that borrows the aesthetics of the printed zine and reimagines them in a digital context.
