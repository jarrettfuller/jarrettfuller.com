discription: 'Originally launched in 2017, <a href="https://jarrettfuller.com/projects/readings">readings.design</a> is a free online library I edit and curate collecting both canonical and recommended readings in and around graphic design. During the summer of 2020, I launched a redesign featuring a more robust tagging system, streamlined sorting, and cleaner interface. The site can be viewed <a href="http://readings.design">here</a>.'
