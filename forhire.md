<h4>Welcome!</h4>

I run my own design practice in Brooklyn, NY; teach at Parsons, Pratt, and University of the Arts; and host a weekly podcast about design criticism. My practice is a combination of client and self-initiated projects and ranges from editorial design to websites, publishing to branding.</p>

<h4>Who I've worked with</h4>
<article><p>I've worked with clients large and small, independently and collaboratively. I can embed myself in larger teams for specific projects and work solo on single projects from start to finish. Independent projects tend to lean towards working with smaller clients on complex projects that enable close collaboration, critical thinking, and long-term relationships. I like thinking about systems and working on cross-platform projects at different levels of development from concept to visual design. I've worked with both technology companies and content creators and I especially love working with cultural clients like galleries, museums, writers, and artists.</p>

<p>Some companies, organizations, and people I've worked with before: Facebook, Instagram, John Hopkins University, Study Hall, Design Observer, Kyle Chayka, Nick Quah, the Whitney Museum of American Art, Warby Parker, and Wondermade.</p>

        <h4>What I do</h4>
            <article><p>Recently, I find myself working with artists, writers, and organizations on small to medium sized web sites, creative direction for new publications, book design, content strategy/information heirarcy, and branding consultation/strategy.</p>

            <p>Some areas I haven't worked as much in but am interested in doing more of include album packaging, exhibition design, and mobile interface design. I'm curious to work in more speculative, research-driven projects that tackle larger problems. It's been a few years since I've done full-scale branding, but am interested in getting back into it.</p>
